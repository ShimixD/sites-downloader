# Hey! Thank you for using my tool "Sites Downloader" :D

Open Downloader.bat and then type the domain you want to visit and download your files located in websites/.

If you use this for pages with Adobe Flash, you may experience errors due to the use of Ruffle.

# How do I export my code modifications?
## First, install the packages inside the _src folder
```console
npm install
```
## And finally, run this command inside the same folder
```console
npm run publish
```
